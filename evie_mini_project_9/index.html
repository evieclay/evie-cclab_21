    <h2>Like the twinkling stars</h2>
    <h2>Like a building with flickering lights</h2>
    <h2>We’re shining</h2>
    <h2>In each of our rooms, in each of our planets</h2>

    <h3>Some of the lights are ambition</h3>
    <h3>Some of the lights are wandering</h3>
    <h3>Everyone’s light</h3>
    <h3>Is so precious</h3>

    <h2>In the dark night (don’t be lonely)</h2>
    <h2>Like the stars (we shine)</h2>
    <h2>Don’t disappear</h2>
    <h2>Because you’re a great existence</h2>
    <h2>Let us shine</h2>

    <h3>The expression of the night is so beautiful</h3>
    <h3>Not because of the stars or starlight, but because of us</h3>

    <h2>You got me</h2>
    <h2>I look at you and dream</h2>
    <h2>I got you</h2>
    <h2>In the dark nights</h2>
    <h2>We saw each other’s light</h2>
    <h2>We were saying the same things</h2>

    <h3>The stars shine the most in the deepest of nights</h3>
    <h3>The stars shine the most in the deepest of nights</h3>
    <h3>The deeper the night, the more the stars shine</h3>

    <h2>Each person has their own history</h2>
    <h2>Each person has their own star</h2>
    <h2>7 billion stars shine</h2>
    <h2>In each of the 7 billion worlds</h2>

    <h3>7 billion lives, the night view of the city</h3>
    <h3>Might be the night of another city</h3>
    <h3>Each dream, let us shine</h3>
    <h3>Brighter than anyone else</h3>
    <h3>One</h3>

    <h2>The expression of the night is so beautiful</h2>
    <h2>Not because of the darkness or the moonlight, but because of us</h2>

    <h3>You got me</h3>
    <h3>I look at you and dream</h3>
    <h3>I got you</h3>
    <h3>In the dark nights</h3>
    <h3>We saw each other’s light</h3>
    <h3>We were saying the same things</h3>

    <h2>The stars shine the most in the deepest of nights</h2>
    <h2>The stars shine the most in the deepest of nights</h2>
    <h2>The deeper the night, the more the stars shine</h2>

    <h3>The light of the city, the stars of the city</h3>
    <h3>I remember the night sky I looked up at when I was young</h3>
    <h3>The light of a person, the star of a person</h3>
    <h3>Fills this place up</h3>
    <h3>We shinin’</h3>

    <h2>You got me</h2>
    <h2>I look at you and breathe</h2>
    <h2>I got you</h2>
    <h2>In the dark nights</h2>

    <h3>Shine, dream, smile</h3>
    <h3>Oh let us light up the night</h3>
    <h3>We shine just as we are</h3>
    <h3>Shine, dream, smile</h3>
    <h3>Oh let us light up the night</h3>
    <h3>We shine just by being us</h3>
    <h3>Tonight</h3>
