      <p class ="text4" style= >For this project, I hope to guide people through the process of designing a tattoo. Art has always been such a major part of my life. Since I was a child, I would always doodle and draw (especially on test papers). I loved to draw flowers, eyes, butterflies, people, etc. Painting became very important to me. Painting was a way to relieve stress and express the emotions that my words could not. I cannot remember the exact age I was when I fell in love with tattoos. The idea of having permanent art on my body seemed so beautiful to me. As an art lover, what more could I want than to have my body be adorned with artwork forever. My desire for tattoos started with simple drawings on my hands during classes (which my dad did not like). I eventually ventured into the realm of “stick n pokes,” a nuanced DIY take on traditional hand-poked tattoos. I hand-poked my first tattoo when I was 15 years old: a sun. I eventually began to add more and more, until it became an obsession. As I grew older, I began to appreciate tattoos more and more, beyond their visual aesthetics. I discovered how meaningful tattoos could be across cultures.My greatest wish was to turn 18 so that I could get a real tattoo. My parents were not very fond of my love for tattoos, but that did not deter me. My very first tattoo was a lotus with my mother’s Chinese name, 鄭友蓮. To me, no other tattoo could have been more meaningful. I understand how many people still view tattoos as taboo or signs of “mischief,” but I wish to expel those stereotypes. At least to me, tattoos are artwork. My skin is simply the canvas. </p>
