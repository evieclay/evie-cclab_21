      <h1 class= "text4">step 1: brainstorm</h1>
      <h2 class= "text5">think deeply about what you want for a tattoo. remember that tattoos are permanent, pick something that is either meaningful to you or something that you find visually appealing! it is always helpful to look online for inspiration!</h2>

      <h1 class= "text4">step 2: style</h1>
      <h2 class= "text5">consider how you want the tattoo to look. do you want a big or small tattoo? black and grey or color? thin or think strokes? there's a lot of stylistic aspects about tattoos that are important to consider while you design!</h2>

      <h1 class= "text4">step 3: placement</h1>
      <h2 class= "text5">think about where on your body you would like your tattoo. remember that certain places might be more sensitive than others (although this depends on the person). do you want a visible tattoo or one that is easily hidden? think about how the tattoo will harmonize with the shape of your body!</h2>

      <h1 class= "text4">step 4: design!!</h1>
      <h2 class= "text5">now it's time to transfer your ideas onto paper. sketch out your imagined tattoo and play around until it best suits your needs!</h2>

      <h1 class= "text4">step 5: try it on</h1>
      <h2 class= "text5">this step is typically done with a tattoo artist. they will print out the designs and tape them to the desired spot to give you an idea of what the tattoo will look like</h2>
